Introductory Pygame Practice

This repository contains code for an introductory Pygame practice project. It's based on the tutorial from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk&t=5744s).

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Pygame installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
```bash
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
python3 runner_learn.py
